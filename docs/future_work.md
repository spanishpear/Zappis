# Future Vision

1. Interactive Circuit Builder
   - Implement a drag-and-drop interface for component placement
   - Add smart wire routing with pathfinding (like PCB design tools)
   - Enable component rotation and scaling
   - Add grid snapping and alignment guides
   - Support both "edit" and "simulation" modes
2. Wire System Improvements
   - Implement Manhattan routing (90-degree angles) for cleaner wire paths
   - Add connection points/ports on components
   - Implement wire bundling for parallel connections
   - Add visual indicators for connection quality/state
   - Support different wire styles (straight, curved, manhattan)
3. Component System Enhancement
   - Create a component registry with metadata
   - Implement a component factory pattern
   - Add component templates/presets
   - Support component groups/subcircuits
   - Enable component property editing through UI
4. Embedding System
   - Create a configuration API for blog integration
   - Support different view modes (full editor, simulation only, guided)
   - Add theming support for visual consistency
   - Implement responsive layouts
   - Add export/import functionality
5. Performance & Technical Improvements
   - Implement component/wire pooling
   - Add WebGL-optimized rendering
   - Support undo/redo operations
   - Add automated testing for circuit logic
   - Implement proper state management
