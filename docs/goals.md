# Goals

This is a simple circuit simulator. It should be able to:

- Draw a circuit with a battery, switch, and LED
- Calculate if the circuit is closed or open
- Animate electrons flowing through the circuit, if it is closed


It will be embedded in a blogpost, so information should be presented in a way that is easy to understand.
The blogposts will be simple electronics tutorials. E.g. "Learning electronics for beginners"

# Tasks
- [x] Have a basic circuit with a battery, switch, and LED
- [x] Allow for the circuit to be calculated as closed or open
- [x] Animate electrons flowing through the circuit, if it is closed
- [ ] Abstract the circuit design in index.ts, so that multiple circuits can be created, e.g - so we can show multiple examples in the blogpost
